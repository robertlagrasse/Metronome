Parking lot for thoughts and notes.

MainActivity -
Removal of legacy database calls for everything but the components.
Need to build default 1, 2, 3, 4 beat patterns, single kit, and 4 jams that load with the software.
These will be the only patterns and the only kit that works offline. Still provides functionality,
but it's super basic if I can't show you ads. Buttons should only be visible if online.

DONE - Pattern Editor button in main activity needs to go away. Need to replace with onLongClick.
DONE - Kit Editor - Ditto
Kit Editor - needs a new icon for the fab in the layout.

Search button - currently points to checkFirebaseForJam(). Retool this method to check the
jams/shared table. - Rebuild to addSharedJamFromFirebase() and disconnect references to
checkFirebaseForJam.

DONE - Find a new Search button icon.

shareJam() needs to be retooled to write to jams/shared.
Share Function needs the proper icon.

Toolbar - names and icons need to reflect what's going on here.
DONE - Search for a shared jam
DONE - Share a jam
DONE - Save Jam to cloud.
DONE - Tempo on the toolbar
DONE - Get the rest of this shit off of the toolbar - Moving Kit and Pattern Editor functions to overflow

Whenever mJam changes, the Tempo slider needs to be properly positioned

Need a numeric indicator for tempo. Toolbar is a good spot for this, in place of "Metronome"

in/outstate - keep track of the last jam the user was working on

Fix graph so MainActivity looks like the PatternEditor

DONE - Fix PatternEditor so it starts with a basic 1 beat pattern.

DONE - Fix PatternEditor so new beats are only 1 beat on.

DONE - Fix sharing so the everything fires properly

Admob

Authentication - pretty necessary

Wear support

Time to knock some stuff out!
