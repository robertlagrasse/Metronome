Parking lot for thoughts and notes.

MainActivity -
Removal of legacy database calls for everything but the components.
Need to build default 1, 2, 3, 4 beat patterns, single kit, and 4 jams that load with the software.
These will be the only patterns and the only kit that works offline. Still provides functionality,
but it's super basic if I can't show you ads. Buttons should only be visible if online.

Pattern Editor button in main activity needs to go away. Need to replace with onLongClick.
Kit Editor - Ditto

Search button - currently points to checkFirebaseForJam(). Retool this method to check the
jams/shared table.

shareJam() needs to be retooled to write to jams/shared.

Whenever mJam changes, the Tempo slider needs to be properly positioned

Need a numeric indicator for tempo. Toolbar is a good spot for this, in place of "Metronome"

in/outstate - keep track of the last jam the user was working on

Fix graph so MainActivity looks like the PatternEditor

Fix PatternEditor so it starts with a basic 1 beat pattern.

Fix sharing so the everything fires properly

Admob

Authentication - pretty necessary

Wear support

Time to knock some stuff out!
