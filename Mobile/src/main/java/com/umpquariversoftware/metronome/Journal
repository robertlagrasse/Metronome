Parking lot for thoughts and notes.

MainActivity -
Removal of legacy database calls for everything but the components.
Need to build default 1, 2, 3, 4 beat patterns, single kit, and 4 jams that load with the software.
These will be the only patterns and the only kit that works offline. Still provides functionality,
but it's super basic if I can't show you ads. Buttons should only be visible if online.

Kit Editor - needs a new icon for the fab in the layout.

Whenever mJam changes, the Tempo slider needs to be properly positioned

in/outstate - keep track of the last jam the user was working on

DONE - Fix graph so MainActivity looks like the PatternEditor
build string array for graph labels so they can be translated.

Admob

Authentication - pretty necessary

Wear support

Time to knock some stuff out!
